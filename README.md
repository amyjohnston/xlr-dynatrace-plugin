# XL Release Dynatrace Plugin
Note: This plugin is for Dynatrace AppMon. If you require Dynatrace OneAgent, please click [here](https://github.com/xebialabs-community/xlr-dynatrace-oneagent-plugin).


## Preface
This document describes the functionality provide by the `xlr-dynatrace-plugin`, as well as potential future functionality.

## Overview
In addition to being a monitoring tool, Dynatrace can be used to collect data during testing. This plugin allows users to query Dynatrace's enhanced test results from XL Release to make decisions about whether or not to continue with a release.

## Supported Tasks
The plugin currently supports five tasks:

* [Register test run](https://community.dynatrace.com/community/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=182356997#SystemProfiles%28REST%29-TestAutomation)
* [Retrieve test results](https://community.dynatrace.com/community/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=182356997#SystemProfiles%28REST%29-TestAutomation)
* [Start session recording](https://community.dynatrace.com/community/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=182356998#Sessions%28REST%29-StartSessionRecording)
* [Stop session recording](https://community.dynatrace.com/community/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=182356998#Sessions%28REST%29-StopSessionRecording)
* [Register deployment](https://community.dynatrace.com/community/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=161922178#Incidents%28REST%29-CreateIncident)

#### Register test run

Registers a test run with Dynatrace and returns the test run ID. This ID needs to be passed to the test tool(s).

#### Retrieve test results

Attempts to retrieve the results of a given test run ID from Dynatrace. By default, the task will wait 10s before calling Dynatrace, to give the Dynatrace server sufficient time to process monitoring data collected from the last test runs.

## Usage

The intended use case for this plugin is to support Dynatrace's ability to monitor runs of unit, UI, load, performance and API tests and provide information about architectural and other metrics that are relevant to go/no-go decisions.

The plugin allows you to retrieve this information from Dynatrace for review or, if desired, an automated decision. The plugin does **not** at present provide any tasks to make such decisions.

## Examples

### Register test run and retrieve results

The canonical flow here involves registering a new test run with Dynatrace and passing the test run ID that is returned to one or more invocations of test tools, either by invoking the test tool directly, or e.g. as a parameter to a Jenkins build.

You would then retrieve the test results from Dynatrace and either review them manually, using e.g. a Gate task, or use a Script task to automatically determine whether to stop or continue.

Note that Dynatrace is not aware of whether a test run has been completed or is still in progress - the call to retrieve tests results will simply return the data available at that moment. You will need to ensure that you set up your template or release so that Dynatrace is not called until the tests you are running have been completed.
